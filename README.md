# Landing Page Project

## Steps of doing this project 
---
_1-Linked the app.js file to the html file_

_2- then used querySelector() methods to get the html elements to work with_

_3- stored the navbar-list id  and section tags in variables_
_4- made a function (addtolist) to create list elements as buttons_
___
### steps for adding your-active-list class:
_1- made a parent function (yourActiveList)_
_2- made a child function (checkSection) to check if the section is in view_
_3- used the previous function in a for-loop to apply the function to every section in the array_

## Some features:
---
##  Navigation buttons change dynamically with the change of the active class of the sections highlighting  the active section
